    <h3> "You don't learn style from watching people on a runway. Fashion happens every morning when you wake up." - Shalom Harlow </h3>
    <p>Shalom Harlow was born on December 5, 1973, in Oshawa, Ontario, Canada. She was discovered at the age of 17 at a The Cure concert, and soon after began her modeling career.</p>
    <p>In the 1990s, she became an iconic supermodel, working with top designers like
        <a href="https://www.versace.com" target="_blank">Versace</a>,
        <a href="https://www.dior.com" target="_blank">Dior</a>,
        <a href="https://www.chanel.com" target="_blank">Chanel</a>,
        <a href="https://www.valentino.com" target="_blank">Valentino</a>, and
        <a href="https://www.alexandermcqueen.com" target="_blank">Alexander McQueen</a>. She stood out for her elegance, versatility, and a unique beauty that challenged the
        conventional standards of the time.
    <p> One of her most legendary moments was the Alexander McQueen Spring 1999 show,
        where robotic arms spray-painted her live on stage, creating one of the most unforgettable performances in fashion
        history.



        After some time away from the spotlight, she made a triumphant comeback in 2018, walking for Versace, proving that
        she remains a timeless and powerful figure in fashion. In 2007, Forbes listed her as one of the worldâ€™s highest-paid models.

    <h3>ðŸŽ­ Why Was Alexander McQueenâ€™s 1999 Show Controversial?</h3>
    <ol>

        <li>
            <h4> Technology on the Runway</h4>
        </li>

        <ul>
            <li> In the showâ€™s finale, Shalom Harlow stood on a rotating platform, wearing a plain white dress.</li>

            <li> Two robotic armsâ€”like the ones used in car factoriesâ€”began spray painting her dress in black and yellow as
                she spun around.</li>
            <li>It was shocking to see industrial machines interacting with a human model in a fashion show.</li>
        </ul>

        <li>
            <h4>An Emotional Performance:</h4>

        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>Shalom wasnâ€™t just modelingâ€”she was performing.</li>

            <li>Her body language expressed vulnerability and confusion, almost like she was being attacked.</li>

            <li>It left viewers with strong emotionsâ€”some saw it as beautiful, others as disturbing. </li>
        </ul>


        <li>
            <h4> A Statement on Fashion Industry:,
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Many interpreted the scene as a critique of how the fashion industry controls and shapes women.</li>

            <li> It was also seen as a commentary on the intersection of art, technology, and identity.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <li>
            <h4> Breaking Tradition:
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>At a time when runway shows were mostly about displaying clothes, McQueen turned fashion into theater, art,
                and provocation. </li>

        </ul>
    </ol>
